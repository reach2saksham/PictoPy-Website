# PictoPy Website

PictoPy is an open-source, privacy-first AI photo management application built for the desktop - featuring on-device face recognition, object detection, and smart search, with zero data leaving your machine.

PictoPy brings the intelligence of modern AI photo management to your local machine, without the privacy trade-offs of cloud-based alternatives. Built as a fully offline desktop application with Rust, React, and Python, PictoPy automatically groups faces across your library, tags photos with detected objects, and lets you search your pictures with simple words - all powered by state-of-the-art on-device models, without an internet connection or a subscription.

## 🛠️ Stack & Commands

- **Stack:** Next.js 16.2.11 App Router (Turbopack), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, `next-intl` (i18n), `next-themes` (light/dark state manager).
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Develop:** `npm run dev`

---

## 🎨 Styles & Theme System

- **Class-Based Dark Mode:** Tailwind CSS v4 is configured for class-based overrides using `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` in [`globals.css`](src/app/[locale]/globals.css).
- **Semantic Tokens:** Do **not** write inline layout dark utilities (e.g., `dark:bg-black` or `dark:text-zinc-50`). Always write semantic classes linked to the central theme variables (e.g., `bg-background-primary`, `text-foreground-primary`).
- **Typography:** The default font family is **Inter**. It is mapped to `--font-sans` in globals.css.

---

## 🌐 i18n & l10n Routing

- **Dynamic segment:** All localized pages and layouts must be nested inside [`src/app/[locale]/`](src/app/[locale]/).
- **Awaiting params:** Layout and Page `params` props are Promises in Next.js 15/16. Always `await params` before accessing `locale`.
- **Navigation:** Never import `Link`, `useRouter`, or `usePathname` from standard `next/link` or `next/navigation`. Always import them from local configuration helpers in [`src/i18n/navigation.ts`](src/i18n/navigation.ts).

---

## 📦 Project Boundaries

- **Config alias map:** Webpack & Turbopack alias resolvers are manually defined in [`next.config.ts`](next.config.ts) mapping `"next-intl/config"` to our local request setup. Do not import the native `@swc/core` compiler plugin wrapper `createNextIntlPlugin` directly to avoid security policy native module blocks.
- **Branding Assets:** The official branding logo, favicon, and style specifications reside inside [`brand/`](brand/).
